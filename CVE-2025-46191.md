## CVE-2025-46191

SourceCodester Client Database Management System 1.0 contains an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the user_payment_update.php file. Due to missing validation on the uploaded_file_cancelled parameter, attackers can upload arbitrary PHP files to a publicly accessible /files/ directory. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server via direct access to the uploaded script, resulting in full RCE without authentication.
