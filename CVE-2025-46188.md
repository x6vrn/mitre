# Advisory: SQL Injection to RCE in SourceCodester Client Database Management System 1.0

**CVE ID**: _Pending Public Disclosure (Currently RESERVED)_  
**Discovered by**: Anas Almizani (@x6vrn)  
**Vendor**: SourceCodester  
**Product**: Client Database Management System using PHP, Bootstrap 5, and AdminLTE  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Vulnerability Type**: SQL Injection  
**Attack Type**: Remote  
**Impact**: Code Execution

## Summary

A critical SQL Injection vulnerability exists in `superadmin_phpmyadmin.php` of SourceCodester Client Database Management System 1.0. The issue allows unauthenticated attackers to inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands, which can be escalated to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the target server.

## Affected Components

The vulnerability is located in the `superadmin_phpmyadmin.php` file:

- **Lines 24–29**: Handles the uploaded `.sql` file without sanitization or validation.
- **Lines 113–132**: Processes the uploaded file using `multi_query()`, which enables execution of multiple SQL statements in a single call.

## Attack Vector

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker uploads a maliciously crafted `.sql` file using the import feature in the web interface. The file is processed using `multi_query()` without input validation, allowing the attacker to:

1. Write arbitrary PHP code to a file in the web directory via SQL statements.
2. Access the uploaded PHP file remotely and execute arbitrary commands.

This leads to full remote code execution on the server.

## Mitigation

The vendor has not released a patch at the time of writing. It is recommended to:

- Validate and sanitize all uploaded SQL files.
- Avoid using `multi_query()` with untrusted input.
- Implement strict input validation and allowlisting on the server.
