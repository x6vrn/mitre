## CVE-2025-46192

SourceCodester Client Database Management System 1.0 is vulnerable to unauthenticated blind SQL injection in user_payment_update.php via the order_id POST parameter. The input is directly embedded into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing remote attackers to extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, through crafted Boolean-based payloads.
